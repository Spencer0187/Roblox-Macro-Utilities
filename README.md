# Roblox Macro Client
An open-source Windows C++ Roblox ImGui Macro with many features.

To Compile, run the project in Visual Studio 2022 and build it.

### Is this A CHEAT???
No, it's a macro, it doesn't communicate with Roblox memory in any way.

### Known Issues
If you get "0x0" or any other key immediately when binding, restart your PC.

If you get DLL errors when launching, install [The Visual Studio 2022 x64 C++ Redist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).

If it doesn't launch at all, go into properties and select "Unblock" on the file.

If you have another issue where keybinds don't work, restart your computer, it seems to fix it permanently.

Downgrading from a version with more functions to a version with less functions causes the program to crash on launch, either delete your RMCsettings.json file, or remove section_order_vector from the .json.
